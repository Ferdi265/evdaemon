communicate with i3 via ipc (socket)

get windows and names via get_tree
subscribe to events

bar module can use info to display bar

=> future: hook i3 commands and execute them from within python, like herbstluftwm
=> (via subscribe binding event and command messages)
=> (bindsym some keys to be "nop" and then act on them from the python script)

=> this will make herbstluftwm and i3 almost interchangable, and very configurable
